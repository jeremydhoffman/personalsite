With congressional negotiations regarding gun reform dominating the headlines in the wake of the Buffalo and Uvalde shootings, this week I decided to take a look at the issue of firearm mortality in the United States. The following graphics provide a brief insight into Americaâ€™s gun violence epidemic.

## Visualizing the School Shooting Crisis

The following map provides a visual representation of the 338 school shootings that have occurred since the Columbine High Shool shooting in 1999. Each circle represents a single incident, and the size of the circles indicate the number of casualties involved.[^1]

## Analyzing the Assocation between Gun Ownership and Firearm Mortality

The following scatter plot shows gun ownership in each state (expressed as a percentage of the population) versus firearm deaths per 100,000 people.

## Visualizing Trends in Firearm Purchases

The following chart depicts the number of FBI NCIS background checks performed each month from 2006 through May 2022. Whilst there is not a 1:1 correlation between background checks and firearm purchases, they are generally viewed as a reasonable approximate of such purchases.

## Breaking Down Firearm Mortality by Intent

The treemap below shows a break down of firearm deaths by intent for the period 2001-2020. As is clear from from the diagram shown, the majority of deaths are a result of suicide rather than homicide.
