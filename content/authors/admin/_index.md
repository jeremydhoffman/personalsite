I am currently a Master of Public Policy (MPP) candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at the Penn State School of Public Policy.

I am a skilled health policy researcher/analyst, trained in legislative and policy analysis, quantitative data analysis, and program evaluation.

In addition to my health policy expertise, I am also an English-qualified lawyer, with over four years’ experience advising clients in the pharmaceutical, food & beverage, media, and technology industries on a range of commercial, litigious, and regulatory / policy-related matters.

Over the course of my legal career, I have worked with a wide range of stakeholders, having practiced both as an in-house lawyer, serving as legal counsel at one of Europe’s largest media and entertainment groups, and as an associate (in private practice) at two top 20 UK-ranked international law firms.

I am also currently serving as the President of the Penn State Public Policy Association (PSPPA) and am the Founding Editor and current Editor-in-Chief of the Penn State Public Policy Journal (PSPPJ), Penn State’s student-led public policy journal.
